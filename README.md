This is a linear Regression Group Project in Linear Regression Modelling Class at Columbia University by my teammates and I . 

DATASET:
We used the dataset from https://data.world/nrippner/ols-regression-challenge . These data were
aggregated from a number of sources including the American Community Survey (census.gov), clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov.
Cancer data set:
33 predictors
1 response (Death_rate)
3,047 observations
County-level data collected from 2010-2016 and 2013 Census
Aggregated from clinicaltrials.gov, cancer.gov, & census.gov
Examined cancer trials, mortality, incidence, and demographics

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Predict cancer mortality rates for US counties. What is the relationship between socioeconomic status and cancer mortality rates in the United States?
